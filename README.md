# capra_toolbox

`work in progress`

## Useful scripts
The `useful_scripts` directory is intended to contain simple scripts tofacilitate development,
especially in docker-less environments.

## Jetson files
The `jetson_files` directory should contain most, if not all, necessary capra files to setup a new
onboard computer or restore it to working conditions.

## Old setup files
For archiving purposes, the initial capra_toolbox files are still available, although not updated.
